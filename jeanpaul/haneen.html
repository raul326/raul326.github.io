                        <p class="mb48 mb-xs-32 poetbio">Ali Harba lost a father in the war. Not once but twice. First his biological father and then his stepfather. The trauma resulted in Ali losing his ability to speak. He has since recovered and is doing much better. His most vivid memory from the war, is when the family all of a sudden had to flee. Ali was standing in the kitchen when his stepfather appeared, terrified, and yelled at everyone to run. At the sound of the explosions, in one jump, Ali landed in his stepfather’s arms. As they ran for their lives, Ali’s stepfather threw blankets over the children’s heads to protect them from the explosions and the falling debris. Ali still remembers the leap he made towards his stepfather, the feeling of control and safety in the midst of chaos. In the settlement in Lebanon, Ali loves doing back-flips in the gymnastics class with the other children. When he is not doing gymnastics or playing football, Ali is learning how to operate a camera in the journalism workshop he attends. The workshop has actually planted a seed. Learning about different paths within journalism, Ali now has his mind set on becoming a war correspondent.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-700 mb16 mt32">My Father's Abuse</h3>
                        <pre>He stormed in, turned off the television, kicked me where I was lying watching TV, 
and started yelling and screaming until the neighbors could hear. 
“God rid me of you, and of the television, and of kids, and kids’ programs! Get out of my sight!”
His stare following my mother, and watching her every move: 
“And you, what are you doing?”,he roared from the top of his lungs.
She choked on words and her tears covered her beautiful features as she started 
whispering “oh dear God, every day the same ...” And before she could finish her sentence, 
he grabbed her by the hair, beat her, and hurled her to the ground.
Her body shattered everything around, even my little brother’s toys and his feeding bottle. 
Fear, tears, and quiver, were our daily bread.
I wish those sufferings were real, and my father...
You, the United Nations calling for the end of violence at home, stop the war in Syria!
I wish my father hadn’t been killed in the war, even though he used to harm us.
That is my wish, just so I can call him ‘Father’ again.

                        <p class="mb48 mb-xs-32 poetbio">Suleiman misses his long walks to school. He was young but he still remembers the 30 minutes it took and how fun his school, friends and teachers were. In retrospect, he wonders why the classes ended as early as 1PM in Syria. Suleiman often thinks of what he could have learned if he’d spent more time on the school bench. As a child, the highlight, every summer was visiting Lebanon with his family. He never imagined they’d later on go to Lebanon as refugees and not as tourists. Suleiman’s little sister hasn’t earned that refugee status yet as she stayed behind in Syria with the grandparents. Before the war, Suleiman wanted to become a policeman like his uncle. He’s had plenty of time to reconsider his choice, and now he’s interested in the field of agricultural engineering; a field where he believes there is much to be done in Syria, improving farming equipment and machines for instance. If Suleiman had a super power, he’d get his hands on a convertible Volvo, and go to live on Mars.</p>

And my childhood’s friends.
From my tiny heart, my big love goes to you.

She kept and keeps questioning why they had to leave her brothers behind to save them from being captured and jailed at checkpoints when leaving Syria three years ago. Other issues she insistently questions are child labor and early marriage. While she understands the compelling circumstances that lead young girls into wedlock, she strongly believes that education sets you free. Waad, true to herself and living up to her name, has promised herself to get an education for a better life, and to become a journalist. No matter what, she is determined to keep the promise.</p>

                        <pre>Who are you? They asked.
We said: 
We are the generation whose life is lost whose dreams are broken in war.
We are the generation who is supposed to succeed in a failed society.
We are the generation who sleeps to the 
sound of gunshots and wakes up to the death of a child.
We are the generation worried about water shortages and electricity cuts.
We are the generation whose safety you took away in exchange of fear and dread.
We are the generation whose laughter you took away and sowed oppression.
We are the generation who has grown too old too soon. 
We are the generation whose burden is too old for our age.
We are the generation for which life is endless hope rooted in childhood.
And despite the immensity of our loss we want to live.
Do you know now who we are?

                        <p class="mb48 mb-xs-32 poetbio">Fatima Al Tamer was born in Idlib, Syria in 2007. After having spent half her years as a refugee, she is counting her blessings as one of the fortunate few attending a public school in Lebanon. She is only 10 years old but worries every day at the thought of being unable to pursue her high school education. In her spare time, she loves to draw, read, and write. She finds comfort in writing. Her biggest fear is losing her parents, and her friends, like her lost friend Noor forced into an early marriage, and to whom she dedicates this poem. Fatima is wiser than her years, and knows the extent of the lifetime of wrongs done to child brides. She is articulate in her views against early marriages which are fueled by hardship, poverty, and traditions. Her biggest hope is returning home, to Syria, and if she could do magic, she would bring back the parents of all orphaned children. Her biggest dream is to become a medical doctor, to heal. Healing, dearest Fatima is close to magic, and we wish you to realize your biggest dream.</p>
                        <h3 class="fw-700 mb16">The Cold</h3>
                        <pre>We used to live in our country, safe.
And then we were displaced to Lebanon, because of war.
I hate winter.
Sitting in our tent, in the harsh cold, the storm rattling the tent’s side walls, 
making dreadful sounds. 
Every day, my dad used to gather some wood and cardboards for warmth.
In Syria, I was never cold, or scared, of winter sounds.
I used to love wintertime, but now, no longer.
Last winter, children died of cold.
This winter, 
I am afraid it will be my turn to go, or one of my siblings and friends.
My God, take us back to our country Syria, where we are safe and warm.

                                    <p class="mb64 mb-xs-32 story-bio">Suleiman misses his long walks to school. He was young but he still remembers the 30 minutes it took and how fun his school, friends and teachers were. In retrospect, he wonders why the classes ended as early as 1PM in Syria. Suleiman often thinks of what he could have learned if he’d spent more time on the school bench. As a child, the highlight, every summer was visiting Lebanon with his family. He never imagined they’d later on go to Lebanon as refugees and not as tourists. Suleiman’s little sister hasn’t earned that refugee status yet as she stayed behind in Syria with the grandparents. Before the war, Suleiman wanted to become a policeman like his uncle. He’s had plenty of time to reconsider his choice, and now he’s interested in the field of agricultural engineering; a field where he believes there is much to be done in Syria, improving farming equipment and machines for instance. If Suleiman had a super power, he’d get his hands on a convertible Volvo, and go to live on Mars. </p>

                                    <p class="mb64 mb-xs-32 story-bio">Ali Harba lost a father in the war. Not once but twice. First his biological father and then his stepfather. The trauma resulted in Ali losing his ability to speak. He has since recovered and is doing much better. His most vivid memory from the war, is when the family all of a sudden had to flee. Ali was standing in the kitchen when his stepfather appeared, terrified, and yelled at everyone to run. At the sound of the explosions, in one jump, Ali landed in his stepfather’s arms. As they ran for their lives, Ali’s stepfather threw blankets over the children’s heads to protect them from the explosions and the falling debris. Ali still remembers the leap he made towards his stepfather, the feeling of control and safety in the midst of chaos. In the settlement in Lebanon, Ali loves doing back-flips in the gymnastics class with the other children. When he is not doing gymnastics or playing football, Ali is learning how to operate a camera in the journalism workshop he attends. The workshop has actually planted a seed. Learning about different paths within journalism, Ali now has his mind set on becoming a war correspondent.</p>

                                    <pre>He stormed in, turned off the television, kicked me where I was lying watching TV, 
and started yelling and screaming until the neighbors could hear. 
“God rid me of you, and of the television, and of kids, and kids’ programs! Get out of my sight!”
His stare following my mother, and watching her every move: 
“And you, what are you doing?”,he roared from the top of his lungs.
She choked on words and her tears covered her beautiful features as she started 
whispering “oh dear God, every day the same ...” And before she could finish her sentence, 
he grabbed her by the hair, beat her, and hurled her to the ground.
Her body shattered everything around, even my little brother’s toys and his feeding bottle. 
Fear, tears, and quiver, were our daily bread.
I wish those sufferings were real, and my father...
You, the United Nations calling for the end of violence at home, stop the war in Syria!
I wish my father hadn’t been killed in the war, even though he used to harm us.
That is my wish, just so I can call him ‘Father’ again.

We said: 
We are the generation whose life is lost whose dreams are broken in war.
We are the generation who is supposed to succeed in a failed society.
We are the generation who sleeps to the 
sound of gunshots and wakes up to the death of a child.
We are the generation worried about water shortages and electricity cuts.
We are the generation whose safety you took away in exchange of fear and dread.
We are the generation whose laughter you took away and sowed oppression.
We are the generation who has grown too old too soon. 
We are the generation whose burden is too old for our age.
We are the generation for which life is endless hope rooted in childhood.
And despite the immensity of our loss we want to live.
Do you know now who we are?

After having spent half her years as a refugee, she is counting her blessings as one of the fortunate few attending a public school in Lebanon. She is only 10 years old but worries every day at the thought of being unable to pursue her high school education. In her spare time, she loves to draw, read, and write. She finds comfort in writing. Her biggest fear is losing her parents, and her friends, like her lost friend Noor forced into an early marriage, and to whom she dedicates this poem. Fatima is wiser than her years, and knows the extent of the lifetime of wrongs done to child brides. She is articulate in her views against early marriages which are fueled by hardship, poverty, and traditions. Her biggest hope is returning home, to Syria, and if she could do magic, she would bring back the parents of all orphaned children. Her biggest dream is to become a medical doctor, to heal. Healing, dearest Fatima is close to magic, and we wish you to realize your biggest dream.</p>

                                    <pre>We used to live in our country, safe.
And then we were displaced to Lebanon, because of war.
I hate winter.
Sitting in our tent, in the harsh cold, the storm rattling the tent’s side walls, 
making dreadful sounds. 
Every day, my dad used to gather some wood and cardboards for warmth.
In Syria, I was never cold, or scared, of winter sounds.
I used to love wintertime, but now, no longer.
Last winter, children died of cold.
This winter, 
I am afraid it will be my turn to go, or one of my siblings and friends.
My God, take us back to our country Syria, where we are safe and warm.

                        Keeping children alive is one question, but making sure they achieve their potential is just as crucial. At stake is not only these children‘s hopes and dreams, but also those of a society, an entire generation. It’s incredibly sad that boys and girls feel they have no opportunities. They know there is something better, but they don‘t think they can attain it. Changing that is our highest priority.
